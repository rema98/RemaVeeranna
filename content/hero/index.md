I'm an software developer and an ML Enthusiast with a drive to learn new things.

Currently a student at University Of Florida [UF](https://www.ufl.edu/) and working as a Student Assistant in UF Davis Cancer Pavillion for medical Research Project.
Outside academics, I like to learn new technologies and build,design new things and solve challenging problems.
